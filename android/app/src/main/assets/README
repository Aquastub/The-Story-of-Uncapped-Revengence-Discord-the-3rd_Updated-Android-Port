This folder contains the files that will be packaged with the built APK.

  These files are not required to be bundled with the application package.
  If they are missing, the app will look instead into the following path:
    /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.stjr.srb2/files/
  Files inside the APK have higher access time than files stored inside
  the user's sdcard.

    * srb2.pk3
    * zones.pk3
    * player.dta
    * patch.pk3

  These files are meant to be bundled with the application package.

    * android.pk3
    * splash.png

  These files are completely optional, and the app may launch with or without
  their presence.

     * music.dta

Do not include files that are too large - if you need to store such files,
please consider asking the user to place them into their sdcard instead.
