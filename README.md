# The-Story-Of-Uncapped-Revengence-Discord-the-3rd
I think the title is self explanitory enough


**FEATURES**
Comes with a Linux Build already built in the "releases" section. If you need to change anything else up, for example where the game's home folder is, you can change that in "doomdef.h"

If you want to compile without Discord RPC (for some reason you weirdo) just use HAVE_DISCORDRPC=0
If you want to compile with Discord RPC (since you're actually a normal person) use HAVE_DISCORDRPC=1

That's mainly about it, i might try to keep stuff up to date but i'm not too sure lol

anyways time for legally obligated stuff or something idk
