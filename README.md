## Compiling

See [SRB2 Wiki/Source code compiling](http://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Source_code_compiling)

Alternatively, you can check out the releases page! These include appimages and .exe files, both for Linux and Windows users, respectively. Wine also exists, so if you're into that, .exe files work for you too I guess.
