**ALTERNATIVES**
- You can check out the releases page! These include appimages and .exe files, both for Linux and Windows users, respectively. Wine also exists, so if you're into that, .exe files work for you too I guess.
- You can also Cross-Compile Between Different Operating Systems too!
- You could also ask a friend to do it for you too, friends are the best after all.
